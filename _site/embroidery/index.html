        <p>Getting to work with an embroidery machine is a deep lesson in working within a limited creative space. Its main constraints are color and continuity; changing threads is a pain and not something you want to do often. It can cut threads on its own, but this takes time and leaves loose ends than all need to be trimmed.</p>

<p>These constraints are soft; if you’re willing to dedicate the time, you can make colorful and discontinuous designs. But the challenge of working within them interested me — what’s the best way to render an image using a single continuous thread?</p>

<p>The first approach was pretty simple — a classic scan-line halftone pattern, which creates vertical peaks of varying height and separation. In practice it’s cool to see them squish up against each other:</p>

  The grip this album had on me...

<p></p>

<p>This was one of my first Processing sketches ever, and it’s a perfect beginner project. I encourage you to try it out, especially if you have access to a digital embroidery machine.</p>

<p>The next thing to try was color; a basic CMYK printing technique wouldn’t take too much time. I did this quite manually, extracting the four layers in Photoshop and rotating them before loading them into the sketch.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If I’d been happier with the results, I might have fully automated the CMYK split, but the effect doesn’t come through unless you back up and really squint. The lines could be made smaller, but there’s another limit; you don’t want to be making a bunch of stitches right next to each other with sub-millimeter spacing.</p>

<p>The other issue is pulling; too many back-and-forth stitches in the same direction will pull the fabric together along that axis. A design with thread going in all directions would solve this, and perhaps solve the issue of detail.</p>

<h2 id="scribbling">Scribbling</h2>

<p>Samer Dabra (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/spongenuity/">@spongenuity</a>) has a procedural, stochastic style originally made for pen plotters. He used it with machine embroidery a few times and it looks fantastic:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/embroidery/hand.png" width="full">
</p>

<p>It’s pretty easy to program a simple version of this; just make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">turtle</a> that wanders in the direction of darker areas on the image. To keep it from getting stuck, draw a corresponding white line on the image so it can avoid areas it’s already drawn over.</p>

<p>With a chosen step length, a number of sample points are taken at that distance from the head of the line. The one with the darkest value is where the line goes next.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/embroidery/1.png" width="full">
</p>

<p>Here’s what this gives us:</p>

<p>[photo]</p>

<p>As you can see, this is not good. Let’s see what we can change about the turtle’s behavior to make it better.</p>

<h2 id="choices">Choices</h2>

<p>The first problem I’m noticing is the uniformity; the turtle seems to be evenly shading every area under a certain threshold without scribbling more over the darkest parts of the image. I think this is because the white trail it leaves on the image is too opaque — it’s set to 50% opacity right now. After one or two passes, even the darkest areas get washed out before the turtle can properly cover them. Let’s try about 10%:</p>

<p>Instead of an arc or a line of sample points, you can make a varied fan that biases towards the current direction of travel:</p>

<p>The sampling can also be biased, keeping the line along the same curve of</p>
