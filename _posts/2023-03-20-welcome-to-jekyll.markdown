In January of 2018, I started working on a new art style using cheap gel pens, printer paper, and a lightbox for tracing. I would print out images in black and white, tape another piece of paper on top, shine the light through from underneath, and get to tracing.

These pieces each took several hours to draw, hunched over a desk adding one line at a time with the pen. Needless to say, I would not be making anything larger than a standard sheet of paper using this method. I started working with Processing later that year, and soon enough I was playing around with the idea of replicating this style digitally.

This was not an easy task, to say the least. After running into a few dead ends and taking some time away, I had a breakthrough in Summer 2020: I found the name of the equation I was trying to solve.

$$ \|\nabla u(x,y)\| = \frac{1}{f(x,y)} $$

This is the [Eikonal Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eikonal_equation). In mathematics you learn to fear the simple things: the one-sentence exam problem, the elegant geometric drawing, and brief equations such as this one. It's simple enough: starting with $f(x,y)$, which in this case is the brightness of our original image, we want the function $u(x,y)$ such that the "steepness" of $u$'s surface, or the magnitude of its gradient, is equal to $1/f$ at any given point.

This way, when we make a topographical map of $g$ by drawing its level sets, those lines bunch up at the steeper areas to make the eye perceive a darker tone there.

It's simple enough to describe what we're trying to do, but our fearful instincts are correct â€” solving the equation is no easy feat. We can discretize the domain into a regular grid (in this case, just the pixel grid of the image) and get an approximate solution for each grid point:
$$U_{ij} = \frac{U_X + U_Y}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(U_X+U_Y)^2 - 2 \left(U_X^2 + U_Y^2 - \frac{1}{f_{ij}^2} \right)}$$

where $U_{ij} = u(i,j)$, $f_{ij}=f(i,j)$, $U_X = \min(U_{i-1,j}, U_{i+1,j})$, and $U_Y = \min(U_{i,j-1}, U_{i,j+1})$.

Now we can use James Sethian's [Fast Marching Method](https://math.berkeley.edu/~sethian/2006/Explanations/fast_marching_explain.html), an algorithm
